# Auto-Docs: Automated Documentation Generator for Python Projects
============================================================

Overview
--------

Auto-Docs is a comprehensive tool that automatically generates documentation for Python repositories using AI-powered analysis and intelligent code parsing. This module provides a robust solution for generating high-quality documentation, saving developers time and effort.

Key Functionality
-----------------

Auto-Docs is designed to analyze Python repositories and generate documentation based on the code structure, comments, and other relevant information. The tool uses a combination of natural language processing (NLP) and machine learning algorithms to identify key concepts, functions, and classes, and then generates documentation in a clear and concise manner.

Usage Examples
--------------

To use Auto-Docs, you can import the module and create an instance of the `RepoAnalyzer` class, passing in the path to the Python repository you want to analyze. The `RepoAnalyzer` class will then analyze the repository and generate documentation using the `DocGenerator` class.

Here is an example of how to use Auto-Docs:
```python
from auto_docs import RepoAnalyzer, DocGenerator

repo_analyzer = RepoAnalyzer('/path/to/repo')
doc_generator = DocGenerator()

doc = repo_analyzer.analyze()
doc_generator.generate(doc)

print(doc)
```
This code snippet demonstrates how to analyze a Python repository using the `RepoAnalyzer` class and generate documentation using the `DocGenerator` class.

Dependencies and Requirements
---------------------------

* `analyzer` module: Provides the `RepoAnalyzer` class for analyzing Python repositories.
* `ai_generator` module: Provides the `DocGenerator` class for generating documentation based on the analyzed data.
* `git_watcher` module: Provides the `GitWatcher` class for monitoring changes in the Python repository.

Notes on Implementation Details
--------------------------------

Auto-Docs uses a combination of NLP and machine learning algorithms to analyze the Python repository and generate documentation. The tool is designed to be highly customizable, allowing developers to fine-tune the analysis and generation process to suit their specific needs.

The `RepoAnalyzer` class uses the `git_watcher` module to monitor changes in the Python repository and update the analysis accordingly. The `DocGenerator` class uses the analyzed data to generate documentation in a clear and concise manner.

By using Auto-Docs, developers can save time and effort by automating the documentation generation process, and ensure that their documentation is accurate, up-to-date, and easy to understand.
